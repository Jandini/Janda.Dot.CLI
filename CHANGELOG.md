# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

 * Create installer script that adds .dots to path. Download directly from git and install

 * Add optional parameter origin to .init command 
 * As developer I want to be able to store help usage within command scripts itself so I can display like ```type _dots.cmd | grep -o -P (?^<=rem).*```  rem usage:, rem desc:
 * Perhaps use find instead grep
 * As user I can upstream local branches using .mirror command ```git log @{push}.. &&echo %ERRORLEVEL%```
 * As user I do not want any of dot commands to close cmd window if execute directly from it
 * As developer I want to remove dynamic dots script generation so it is easier to maintain dots command

 * As user I want to be able to undo last commit with keeping changes by default so I can commit the changes again
 * Command .release should try to checkout branch like feature does 

 * Separate .addsvc .addlib. .addlib add simple class 
 * Make add *.cmd dot parameters common i.e. addtest is the same as addlib
 * Add namespace parameter to addlib or addtest commands e.g. .addlib . Janda.Runtime  OR .addlib Janda.Runtime.OS Janda.Runtime
   This will generate <RootNamespace>Janda.Runtime</RootNamespace> in .csproj

 * double-dots scripts represents flows ?
